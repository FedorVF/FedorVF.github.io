</font </em> (Introductory Talk) 
<p>We will examine the basic problem of edge searching, and some of the common restrictions: that searches be monotonic, connected, internal, or some combination of these three. We will examine the relationships between these restrictions, particularly inequalities that arise, and examples showing that these inequalities can be strict. We will also discuss some lower bounds that aided in the construction of these examples.    </p>         </li>

<p>
It is well known that many NP-hard problems become polynomially solvable when restricted to instances whose underlying
graphs have bounded tree-width. The notion of tree-width can easily be extended to hypergraphs by simply
considering the tree-width of their primal graphs. But doing so implies a loss of information
on the structure of the hypergraphs. For this reason, G. Gottlob, N. Leone and F. Scarcello 
introduced the notion of hypertree-width.
Bounded hypertree-width gives
rise to larger classes of tractable instances of NP-hard problems.
For instance, the class of all acyclic hypergraphs has 
hypertree-width 1, while the tree-width is unbounded. 

<p>
One way to understand hypertree-width is via 
the monotone robber and marshals game, a game similar to the (monotone) 
robber and cops game characterising tree-width.
I will give a short introduction to the theory of hypertree decompositions, with
main focus on the game-theoretic characterisation of hypertree-width. 
While the robber and cops game and its monotone variant coincide, this is not true for
the robber and marshals game and its monotone variant. I will present a hypergraph witnessing this.
Nevertheless, the two game variants do not differ much. 
I will conclude with some recent results and open problems.

<p>
In the rendezvous search problem two or more agents initially
located a different nodes of a graph must devise
strategies that allow them to meet at the same node. A number
of variations on the problem have been considered depending
upon the properties of the agents and of the underlying graphs.
A short survey of recent results in this area will be given
along with open problems.</p>

<li><A name="kreutzer"></A>09:25-09:50 Stephan Kreutzer, <font color=FF0000> Digraph Decompositions: DAG-Width, Kelly-Width, and Applications </font </em>
<p>
Following the tremendous success of undirected graph decompositions in
graph structure theory as well as algorithm theory, decompositions of
directed graphs have received growing attention in recent years.
Following the introduction of directed tree-width by Reed and Johnson,
Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas, various authors have proposed
generalisations of notions such as tree-width or path-width from
undirected to directed graphs.</p>
<p>
In this talk we will concentrate on two approaches to generalise
tree-width to digraphs. The first is based on a translation of the
standard cops-and-robber game for tree-width. This leads to the notion
of DAG-width which was shown to have some interesting algorithmic
applications. The second approach is based on translations of the inert
cops-and-robber game, elimination orderings, and partial k-trees to
digraphs. The three concepts are shown to be equivalent. This leads to
the new notion of the Kelly-width of a digraph. We comment on
algorithmic applications and relate the two types of decompositions to
other known notions of digraph decompositions.</p>

<li><A name="barat"></A>09:50-10:15 Janos Barat, <em> <font color=FF0000> Searching directed graphs </font </em>
<p>Let a directed graph $D$ be given. We consider the following cops- and-robber game:
The robber stands on a vertex, and he can run at infinite speed
to any other vertex along the directed edges in the indicated  direction.
He is not permitted to run through a cop, however.
The cops stand also on the vertices, and move by helicopters
from vertex to vertex.
We assume in this version, that the robber is invisible.
The cops {\em capture} the robber, if a cop lands on a vertex, where
the robber stands and can not move anywhere.
That is, all out-neighbors are also occupied by cops.</p>
<p>
The goal is to decide how many cops are necessary to capture the  robber.
We denote this minimum by $\overline{cn}(D)$.</p>
<p>
In a recent paper, we have proved the monotonicity of this game.
We also believe that the directed path-width defined by Reed,  Seymour and Thomas is the same as $\overline{cn}(D)-1$. We could  only prove that these two values differ by at most one.</p>
<p>
We have tried to characterize the directed graphs, where two cops  are enough to capture the robber in the above game. To do so, we  introduced a relation called "bb-minor", which is an extension of  the "butterfly minor". It is worth mentioning, that we could not  find an infinite antichain of digraphs with respect to "bb-minor".</p>
<p>
We will bring up numerous open questions in connection with the  above cops-and-robber game.</p>

<li><A name="nisse"></A>10:15-10:40 Nicolas Nisse,<em> <font color=FF0000> Monotonicity of Non-deterministic Graph Searching</font </em> 
<p>
In graph searching, a team of searchers want to capture a fugitive
 moving in a graph. Several variants of this game have been studied,
 among which visible graph searching in which the searchers
 permanently know the position of the fugitive, and invisible graph
 searching in which the searchers are unaware of the position of the
 fugitive. Strategies for which the part of the graph reachable by
 the fugitive never grows are called monotone. Monotone
 strategies may require more searchers than general strategies to
 catch the fugitive. This is however not the case for visible and
 invisible graph searching. Two important consequences of the
 monotonicity of visible and invisible graph searching are: (1) the
 decision problem corresponding to computing the minimum number of
 searchers to clear the graph is in NP, and (2) computing minimal
 search strategies is simplified by taking into account that there
 exist some that never backtrack.</p>
<p>
 Fomin et al. (2005) introduce an important graph searching
 game that unifies visible and invisible search games. It is called
 non-deterministic graph searching. In this variant, searchers can
 query an oracle that knows where the fugitive currently stands. The
 question of monotonicity of non-deterministic graph searching is
 however left open.</p>
<p>
 In this talk, we prove that non-deterministic graph searching is
 monotone. In particular, this result is a unified proof of
 monotonicity for visible and invisible graph searching. As a
 consequence, the decision problem corresponding to the
 non-determinisitic search game belongs to NP. Moreover, the exact
 algorithms designed by Fomin et al. do compute minimal
 non-deterministic search strategies.</p>
