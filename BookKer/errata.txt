Lemma: Let v be in T1, and suppose its neighborhood in F is a double edge clique C. Then there exists an optimal FVS S in G that avoids v.

Proof: Let S be an optimal FVS of G. If v \notin S we are done. If v is in S, observe that there is at most one vertex x of C that is is not in S. Let S’ = (S-{v}) \cup C, we have that |S’| \leq |S|. We claim that S’ is an FVS. Indeed v has degree at most one in G-S’ and so there are no cycles in G-S’ containing v. Cycles in G-S’ avoiding v also avoid S, contradicting that S is an FVS. 

Corollary: Let v in T1 and c be any vertex in C adjacent to v by a double edge. There exists an optimal FVS of G containing c.
Pf: take one that avoids v, it contains c. 

This leads to an extra Reduction Rule FVS.4B: if v is in T1 and its neighborhood is a double Edge Clique C, and v is adjacent to c in C by a double Edge, then remove c and reduce the parameter k by 1.


Assuming this rule is applied exhaustively v is not incident to any double edges and the rule may now be applied 


Proof of Claim 3.12. (Opposite direction.) 


Let v be the vertex of degree 1 in T whose neighborhood in T is a double edge clique. Let u be its neighbor in T. Let w be the vertex resulting from the contraction. We want to prove that if G/uv has a FVS S' of size at most k then G has a FVS of size at most k.
Let S' be an FVS of G/uv.

Case 1: S' does not contain w. Then S' is a vertex set in G, and we claim that S' is a FVS in G. We have that (G-S') / uv = (G/uv) - S'. So (G-S') / uv is acyclic.  Contracting an edge (when keeping double edges) can not turn a cyclic graph into acyclic, thus  G-S' is acyclic as well.

Case 2: S' contains w. Let S = (S' - {w})\cup {u}. We claim that S is a FVS of G. Suppose not, and let Q be a cycle in G - S.  We have that G-S = (G-S’) \cup v. So G-S is an acyclic graph (namely G-S’) plus one vertex v. So Q must go through v. Because of the reduction rule FVS4.a, there are no double edges connecting v with vertices of C. Thus the neighbors of v in Q are two different vertices. 
But (since u is in S), both neighbors of v in Q are both in C, contradicting that Q is an induced cycle (since these two neighbors are connected by a double edge in C and thus form a cycle in G and in G'). This is a contradiction.
